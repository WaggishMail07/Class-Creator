# Class-Creator
helps with basic class creation for JAVA classes.
To run the program you will need the ability to run JAVA.
This will likely be a bit of a quick and dirty prorgam, sorry for any errors.
This helps you create classes by asking for class data, such as, class name, if it is: public/private, static, final, etc. It also asks for variable names/types, and then when you are done, creates a .txt file with the class declaration, fields, setters, and getters, using the information you provided. 
You can also choose to only do certian parts.

I may add the ability to have the package, and (as a personal prefference) static data validation methods as well.


Explanation of "static data validation":  static methods that take an input(s) and return a bolean value, or throw an exception. They return try if the inputed value is valid, and the exception if it is not. The reason I use these is because they can called from constructors, and allow the entire class to use the data validation.
